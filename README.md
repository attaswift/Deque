`Deque<Element>` implements a double-ended queue type.
It's an `Array`-like random-access collection of arbitrary elements that provides efficient O(1) insertion and deletion at both ends.

Deques are structs and implement the same copy-on-write value semantics as standard collection types like 
`Array` and `Dictionary`.

## Compatibility

`Deque` on the `master` branch is compatible with Swift 4.2.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

If you use CocoaPods, you can start using `Deque` by including it as a dependency in your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'Deque', '~> 3.1'
```

### Carthage

For Carthage, add the following line to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "attaswift/Deque" ~> 3.1
```

### Swift Package Manager

For Swift Package Manager, add `SipHash` to the dependencies list inside your `Package.swift` file:

```
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyPackage",
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/attaswift/Deque.git", from: "3.1.1")
    ]
)
```
